Arduino client is a library that allows connecting your IoT devices to the thinger.io cloud platform, or even your private server deployment. This is a library specifically designed for the Arduino IDE, so you can easily connect your devices.

It supports multiple network interfaces like Ethernet, Wifi, and GSM. It requires the latest Arduino version (at least 1.6.3).

## TODO

This library is currently being developed and should not be integrated in any production device until it is more mature and tested. The library interface may change as it evolve to a stable version. Some things that requires attention now are:

 - Document code
 - Provide more examples and use cases
 - Test with different devices that support the Arduino IDE (Tested on CC3200 with Energia).
 - Improve the reconnection mechanism for some interfaces.
